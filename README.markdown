History
-------
jHashtools is the java-port of a tool that was developed a couple of years ago
for computing the digests of a complete directory tree. It could also take the
output of a previous run and check if all the files mentioned in the file were
contained in the directory and vice-versa. This tool was implemented in python.
Although python is a quite beautiful language, it contained a lot of glued-on
functionality which was quite hard to maintain.

This tool
---------
This tool does the same as the above mentioned use case. It was implemented in
java because that's the language that's used most at the moment and it strikes
are quite good balance between ease of writing and speed.
